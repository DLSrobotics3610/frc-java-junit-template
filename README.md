# FRC Java JUnit Template
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/246overclocked/frc-java-junit-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/246overclocked/frc-java-junit-template)

A template Java project for FRC using JUnit and Ant for building and unit testing.

## Who should use this repository
Whether you're an FRC team that wants to make a new project or build on an existing one, the purpose of this repo is to provide an example as a template to integrate JUnit and Travis Continuous Integration into a Java FRC project. [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a website that integrates with GitHub that will automatically build and test your code every time you push to GitHub.

## To use JUnit in your project
  1. Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/246overclocked/frc-java-junit-template.git`
  2. [Make a new FRC Java project in Eclipse](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145307-creating-your-benchtop-test-program), or find your existing FRC project
  3. Replace the your `build.xml` with the `build.xml` in this repository
  4. Copy the `lib/` folder in this repository into the root folder of your FRC Java project (for example, in this template project, the root folder is `frc-java-junit-template`)
  5. Open `lib/wpilib/wpilib.properties` and change 246 in the line `team-number=246` to your team's number
  6. Create a `test` folder next to `src` in the project's root folder.

All unit tests will live in the `test` folder in packages that correspond to the code in `src` under test. For Ant to run the tests, the names of the files containing tests must end in `Test.java`. For more details on how to structure the code in the `test` folder, see ["Writing JUnit tests" in CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/246overclocked/frc-java-junit-template/blob/cleanup-instructions/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-junit-tests). Note that if there are no tests written in the `test` folder, Ant will have no tests to run.

(Optional): GitHub users, copy over the `.gitignore` in this repository. This will ensure you will only commit Java source code and other essential files (but not compiled binaries).

Hooray! Now you have set up JUnit in your FRC Java project. Next follow the steps in [installation](#installation) to get Apache Ant on your computer. Afterwards, continue to [usage](#usage) to see how to use Ant to deploy to the robot, and run all JUnit tests.

### Enable Travis for automatic building & testing (optional)
  1. Copy the `.travis.yml` into the corresponding location in your FRC Java project
  2. Go to https://travis-ci.org/ and sign in with your GitHub username.
  3. Click the + sign and flip the switch on to ON for the GitHub repository with your FRC Java project
  4. Make a push to GitHub

Then voila, Travis will automatically build and test your project.

## Installation
All FRC projects use **Apache Ant** to build and deploy code for the robot. In addition, this project also uses Ant to run unit tests. All libraries and dependencies are included in the project, so no external downloads are necessary. The only requirement is to have Ant installed on your computer.

**Determine if you already have Ant installed:** open Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows) and type `ant -version`. If that outputs a version of Ant, then it is already installed and you can skip down to [usage](#usage). If you get something else, you need to install Ant.

### Installing Ant on Mac

On OS X, the easiest way is to [install Homebrew](http://brew.sh), open up a terminal, and type `brew install ant`. (If you have MacPorts installed, you can install Ant with `sudo port install apache-ant`.)

### Installing Ant on Windows

[Download Ant](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) and follow the installation instructions, then set up Ant for the command line on Windows (cmd or powershell): 

  1. Add new environment variable `ANT_HOME` and point it to the place where Ant is installed (as Eclipse Plugin or standalone). You can do this temporarily (or for a single session) by using the command `set [variable]=[path]` in cmd or `$env:Variable = 'path'` in powershell, or you can do this permanently by right-clicking on 'My Computer' (or 'This PC') and going to Properties > Advanced system settings (on the left) > Environment Variables. In the window that pops up, you can add the variable `ANT_HOME` equivalent to the Ant installation folder in System variables. 

  1. Append `%ANT_HOME%\bin` to the `Path` envoronment variable under System variables (see the step above) by selecting it in the list of System variables and clicking Edit... - if it is blank, or if you could not find this variable and create it you can simply add `%ANT_HOME%\bin` as the value. If you found it containing a value already, however, **do not delete its contents**, but add `;%ANT_HOME%\bin` to its contents (with a **semi-colon** and **no spaces**). 

## Usage

### Running Ant from the Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows)
Open the terminal (command line on Windows) and `cd` to the root directory of the project (where `build.xml` is located), in this case the `FRC Java JUnit Template` folder. All Ant commands are of the form `ant [target]` and run in the root directory of the project. Run `ant -p` to see a description of available targets:
```
frc-java-junit-template$ ant -p
Buildfile: [...]/frc-java-junit-template/build.xml
Trying to override old definition of task classloader

Main targets:

 clean         Clean up all build and distribution artifacts.
 compile       Compile the source code.
 debug-deploy  Deploy the jar and start the program running.
 deploy        Deploy the jar and start the program running.
 test          Compile source code and run all junit tests.
Default target: deploy
```
Each "target" is a subcommand you can run. For example `ant deploy` deploys the code to the robot, and is equivallent to deploying from the Eclipse. Most importantly, `ant test` will run automatically run all JUnit tests in the `frc-java-junit-template/test` source directory. If no target is specified (by just running `ant` without a target), Ant will default to 'deploy'.

### Running Ant from Eclipse

  1. Copy over `frc-java-junit-template_build.xml.launch` and `frc-java-junit-template_test.xml.launch` into your project's root folder. Rename the prefix of these files from `frc-java-junit-template` to the name of your project and open each file and replace every occurence of `frc-java-junit-template` with the name of your project.

  1. Then, make sure you have no Ant Build configurations already set (you can check by going to Run > External Tools > External Tools Configurations... and looking on the left of the window that pops up) and deleting any ones that have already been set. 

  1. Go to File > Import... > select Launch Configurations under Run/Debug > check off the 'frc-java-junit-template' directory on the left (you should see two configuration files checked off on the right) > Finish. 
  **Note:** you may notice that running `git status` after this step reveals that the two configuration files you just imported were deleted - this is completely normal, but be sure to run `git stash` in order to restore these files. 

  1. Right-click on the build.xml file in the frc-java-junit-template directory in the package explorer, select Run As > 1 Ant Build (the first option on the list). 

  1. You should now see two Ant Build configurations on the left of the window that pops up: 'frc-java-junit-template_build.xml' (this one deploys the code to the RoboRIO) and 'frc-java-junit-template_test.xml' (this one just runs all the tests) - select one of them and click 'Run' at the bottom of the window. You will see the output of the Ant Build in the Eclipse output console. 

  1. You can select configurations you've run previously by clicking on the drop-down list next to the deploy button with a red tool chest under it (located just to the right of the usual deploy button) or going back the the 'External Tools Configurations' menu mentioned above.
